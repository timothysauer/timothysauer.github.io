<h3>EXERCISES 3.4</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle} \)
<b>1 (a)</b> Calculating \(S_0'(x)=3x^2+1\) and
\(S_1'(x)=-3(x-1)^2+6(x-1)+3\), note that \(S_0'(1)=4\) and \(S_1'(1)=3\),
so that \(S(x)\) is not a cubic spline. <p>
<b>1 (b)</b> The derivatives are
\begin{align*}
S_0'(x)&=6x^2+2x+4\\
S_0''(x)&=12x+2\\
S_1'(x)&=3(x-1)^2+14(x-1)+12\\
S_1''(x)&=6(x-1)+14
\end{align*}
Calculating \(S_0(1)=12\), \(S_0'(1)=12\), \(S_0''(1)=14\), and \(S_1(1)=12\),
\(S_1'(1)=12\), \(S_1''(1)=14\), we conclude that \(S(x)\) is a cubic
spline.

<b>3 (a)</b> The second derivatives \(S_0''(x)=\frac{9}{2}x\) and
\(S_1''(x)=-\frac{9}{2}(x-1)+2c\) must agree at \(x=1\), implying that
\(\frac{9}{2}=2c\), or \(c=\frac{9}{4}\). Since \(S_0''(0)=0\) and
\(S_1''(2)=-\frac{9}{2}+\frac{9}{2}=0\), the spline is natural. The
spline fails the not-a-knot condition because
\(S_0'''(1)=\frac{9}{2}\neq -\frac{9}{2}=S_1'''(1)\), and is not
parabolically terminated because of the degree \(3\) terms. <p>
<b>3 (b)</b> The second derivatives \(S_0''(x)=8\) and \(S_1''(x)=2c\)
must agree at \(x=1\), thus \(c=4\). The spline is parabolically
terminated because of the absence of degree \(3\) terms, and is
not-a-knot because \(S_0'''(1)=0=S_1'''(1)\). It fails to be natural
because \(S_0''(0)=8\neq 0\). <p>
<b>3 (c)</b> The first derivatives \(S_0'(x)=-\frac{3}{2}+7x-3x^2\) and
\(S_1'(x)=c+(x-1)-3(x-1)^2\) must agree at \(x=1\), so \(c=\frac{5}{2}\).
Since \(S_0''(0)=7-6(0)=7\neq 0\), the spline is not natural. It is
not parabolically terminated because of the nonzero degree \(3\)
terms. The spline is not-a-knot because \(S_0'''(1)=S_1'''(1)=-6\) and
\(S_1'''(2)=S_2'''(2)=-6\).
<hr>

<b>5</b> By Theorem 3.6, there is exactly one natural cubic spline
through any three points with distinct \(x\) coordinates. The cubic
spline \(S_0(x)=S_1(x)=x\) on \([0,1]\) and \([1,2]\), respectively, satisfies
the conditions.
<hr>

<b>7 (a)</b> There are \(n=3\) given data points. First calculate
\(\delta_1=x_2-x_1=1-0=1\), \(\delta_2=x_3-x_2=2-1=1\), \(\Delta _1=y_2-y_1=1-0=1\),
\(\Delta _2=y_3-y_2=4-1=3\). Equation (3.26) has the form
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1&0&0\\
1&4&1\\0&0&1\\
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_0\\c_1\\c_2\\
\end{array}\right]=
\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\6\\0\\
\end{array}\right]\]
with solutions \(c_0=0\), \(c_1=\frac{3}{2}\), \(c_2=0\). Equation (3.24)
yields
\[d_0=\frac{c_1-c_0}{3\delta_0}=\frac{\frac{3}{2}-0}{3(1)}=\frac{1}{2}\]
\[d_1=\frac{c_2-c_1}{3\delta_1}=\frac{0-\frac{3}{2}}{3(1)}=-\frac{1}{2}\]
and equation (3.25) gives
\[b_0=\frac{\Delta_0}{\delta_0}-\frac{\delta_0}{3}(2c_0+c_1)=\frac{1}{2}\]
\[b_1=\frac{\Delta_1}{\delta_1}-\frac{\delta_1}{3}(2c_1+c_2)=2\]
The cubic spline is therefore
\begin{align*}
S_0(x)&=0+\frac{1}{2}x+0x^2+\frac{1}{2}x^3\hspace{1.4in}\text{on}\ \ \ \ \
[0,1]\\
S_1(x)&=1+2(x-1)+\frac{3}{2}(x-1)^2-\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^3\ \ \ \ \ \text{on}
\ \ \ \ \ [1,2].
\end{align*}
<b>7 (b)</b> There are \(n=3\) data points. Calculate \(\delta_0=2\),
\(\delta_1=1\), \(\Delta_0=0\), \(\Delta_1=3\). System (3.26) is
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1&0&0\\
2&6&1\\0&0&1\\
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_0\\c_1\\c_2\\
\end{array}\right]=
\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\9\\0\\
\end{array}\right]\]
with solutions \(c_100\), \(c_1=\frac{3}{2}\), \(c_2=0\). Equation (3.24)
implies \(d_0=\frac{1}{4}\), \(d_1=-\frac{1}{2}\) and equation (3.25)
implies \(b_0=-1\), \(b_1=2\). The cubic spline is therefore
\begin{align*}
S_0(x)&=1-(x+1)\hspace{1in}+\frac{1}{4}(x+1)^3\hspace{.2in}\text{on}\ \ \ \ \
[-1,1]\\
S_1(x)&=1+2(x-1)+\frac{3}{2}(x-1)^2-\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^3\ \ \ \ \ \text{on}
\ \ \ \ \ [1,2].
\end{align*}

<b>9</b> Setting \(S_0(1)=S_1(1)\) implies \(4+b_1=1\), or \(b_1=-3\).
Setting \(S_0'(1)=S_1'(1)\) implies \(b_0+3=b_1\), or \(b_1=0\). Therefore
\(S_0'(0)=b_0+3(0)^2=-3\), and \(S_1'(3)=b_1+6(3-1)-6(3-1)^2=-12\).
<hr>

<b>11 (a)</b> By Theorem 3.7, there is exactly one parabolically
terminated cubic spline through the three points. The parabola
passing through the three points,  used on both intervals \([0,1]\)
and \([1,2]\), will be the unique spline. By Newton divided
differences:

The parabola is \(S(x)=2-2x+2x(x-1)=2x^2-4x+2\). <p>
<b>11 (b)</b> We know from Section 3.1 that there are infinitely many
degree \(3\) polynomials through the three points. Each can be used as
a not-a-knot spline. The cubic polynomials are
\(S(x)=2x^2-4x+2+cx(x-1)(x-2)\)
for arbitrary \(c\neq 0\).
<hr>

<b>13 (a)</b> The coefficient \(b_0) can be found from the spline property \(S'_0(1) = S'_1(1)\), or \(b_0-\frac{10}{9}1+\frac{5}{3}1^2 = \frac{14}{9}\), 
which implies \(b_0=1\). Similarly, \(c_1\) is found from \(S''_0(2)=S''_1(2)\), or \(\frac{20}{9}-4=2c_2\), which implies \(c_2=-8/9\). <p>
<b>13 (b)</b> A spline is natural if \(0=S''(0)=S''(3)\). Neither is true, since \(S''(0) = -10/9\) and \(S''(3)=-\frac{16}{9}-\frac{2}{3}=-22/9\). <p>
<b>13 (c)</b> The clamps are \(S'_0(0) = b_1=1\) and \(S'_2(3)=\frac{16}{9}+2(-\frac{8}{9})-\frac{1}{3}=-1/3\).
<hr>

<b>15</b> If a cubic spline is natural and parabolically terminated,
then \(S_0(x)=a_1+b_1(x-x_1)+c_1(x-x_1)^2\) and \(S_0''(x_1)=0\).
Differentiating gives \(S_0''(x)=2c_0\), implying \(c_0=0\), and
\(S_2(x)\) is linear. The same argument applies to show that
\(S_{n-2}(x)\) is linear.
<hr>

<b>17</b> We have \(S_0(x)=1\), \(S_1(x)=1+b_1+c_1x^2+d_1x^3\).
Differentiating, \(S_1'(x)=b_1+2c_1x+3d_1x^2\) and
\(S_1''(x)=2c_1+6d_1x\). The spline conditions imply
\(0=S_0'(0)=S_1'(0)=b_2\) and \(0=S_0''(0)=S_1''(0)=2c_1\); in other
words, the conditions are satisfied provided that \(0=b_1=c_1\), for
arbitrary \(d_1\). Thus \(S_1(x)=1+d_1x^3\) works for any \(d_1\).
<hr>

<b>19</b> Since there are infinitely many parabolas through \(n=2\)
data points with distinct \(x\) coordinates, there are infinitely many
parabolically terminated cubic splines. Thus existence holds but
uniqueness fails.
<hr>

<b>21 (a)</b> Infinitely many. For a three point spline, not-a-knot implies \(S_0(x)=S_1(x)\). 
We know from Section 3.1 that there are infinitely many degree 3 polynomials \(S(x)\) through the three points. <p>
<b>21 (b)</b> Choose \(S_0(x)=S_1(x)\) to be any degree three polynomial through \((0,0), (1,1)\), and \((2,4)\), 
for example \(S(x)=x^2+cx(x-1)(x-2)\) for any nonzero \(c\).
