<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEMS 6.3</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle} \)
<b>1 (a)</b> The code <tt>euler2.py</tt> in Program 6.2  can be used to calculate the
two approximations, for step sizes \(h=0.1\) and \(h=0.01\). For \(h=0.1\), the global
truncation errors are \([0.1973, 0.1592]\) for \(w_{n1}\) and \(w_{n2}\), \(n=10\).
 For \(h=0.01\), the global
truncation errors are \([0.0226, 0.0149]\) for \(w_{n1}\) and \(w_{n2}\), \(n=100\). The errors
decrease by roughly a factor of 10 for the smaller step size, as expected for a first
order method. The plots of the two approximations and the correct solution (dashed)
are below. <p>

<b>1 (b)</b> Similar to (a). The global truncation errors are \([0.0328, 0.0219]\) for
step size \(h=0.1\), and \([0.0031, 0.0020]\) for \(h=0.01\). <p>

<b>3</b> To modify <tt>pend</tt> to exhibit damping, add the term \(-dy_2\) to the \(y_2'\)
equation in the <tt>ydot</tt> function, where \(d=0.1\). All initial conditions lead toward
the straight-down position of the pendulum, except for the straight-up position
\(y_1(0)=\pi, y_2(0)=0\). In theory, this position is an unstable steady-state, meaning
that it will never move unless there is a small outside perturbation.
For a physical pendulum, small perturbations will occur, and the pendulum will fall from
the up position. The outcome of the simulation with <tt>pend</tt> depends on the step size
and the fact that in current versions of Matlab, \(\sin \pi\) is not exactly zero. It differs
on the order of machine epsilon, providing the perturbation needed, at least when
step size \(h=0.05\) is used,
to cause the pendulum to fall and eventually move to the straight-down position as a
physical pendulum would.
<hr>

<b>5</b> To modify <tt>pend</tt> to exhibit periodic forcing and damping,
add the term \(-dy_2+A\sin t\) to the \(y_2'\)
equation in the <tt>ydot</tt> function, where \(d=1\) and \(A=12\). After waiting for
transient effects to die down, the pendulum will settle into one of
two stable trajectories. One of them makes three and one-half clockwise revolutions
followed by two and one-half counterclockwise revolutions, and repeats. The other
does the same, replacing clockwise with counterclockwise. For example, the initial
condition \((y_1, y_2)=(0.2, 0)\) settles into the first motion, and the initial
condition \((y_1, y_2)=(0.15, 0)\) converges to the second.
<hr>

<b>7</b> The <tt>ydot</tt> function in <tt>pend.m</tt> must be modified to solve the system
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_1'&=&y_2\\
y_2'&=& \left(-\frac{g}{l}+A\cos 2\pi t \right)\sin y_1-dy_2
\end{eqnarray*}
where \(g=9.81, l=2.5\). Starting with an initial position that is close to, but not
exactly, zero (for example, \((y_1,y_2)=(0.01,0)\)), one finds that for \(A\) above \(13.2\),
the downward position is unstable as defined in the Computer Problem, in that the pendulum
travels through the upward position.
<hr>

<b>9</b> To adjust <tt>orbit.m</tt> to solve the two-body problem, 
the stationary sun must be changed into a moving body. Eliminate the lines
<pre>
sun=animatedline('color','y','Marker','.','markersize',50);
addpoints(sun,0,0)
</pre>
and replace with
<pre>
head2=animatedline('color','r','Marker','.','markersize',35);
tail2=animatedline('color','b','LineStyle','-');
</pre>
New <tt>clearpoints</tt> and <tt>addpoints</tt> commands must
be added for <tt>head2</tt> and <tt>tail2</tt>. Notice that <tt>y</tt> is now an
eight-dimensional vector, requiring additions to the initial conditions and
to the differential equation. The formulas of type (6.45) should be added
to <tt>ydot</tt>:
<pre>
function z = ydot(t,x)
m2=0.3;g=1;mg2=m2*g;m1=0.03;mg1=m1*g;
px1=x(1);py1=x(3);vx1=x(2);vy1=x(4);
px2=x(5);py2=x(7);vx2=x(6);vy2=x(8);
dist=sqrt((px2-px1)^2+(py2-py1)^2);
z=zeros(1,8);
z(1)=vx1;
z(2)=(mg2*(px2-px1))/(dist^3);
z(3)=vy1;
z(4)=(mg2*(py2-py1))/(dist^3);
z(5)=vx2;
z(6)=(mg1*(px1-px2))/(dist^3);
z(7)=vy2;
z(8)=(mg1*(py1-py2))/(dist^3);
</pre>
