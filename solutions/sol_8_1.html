<h3>EXERCISES 8.1</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle} \)
<b>1 (a)</b> \(u_t = 2e^{2t+x}+2e^{2t-x}\) and \(u_{xx}
= e^{2t+x}+e^{2t-x}\), so the heat equation \(u_t=2u_{xx}\) holds.
Substitute \(t=0, x=0\) and \(x=1\),
respectively, to check the boundary conditions. <p>
<b>1 (b)</b> \(u_t = 2e^{2t+x}\) and \(u_{xx}
=e^{2t+x}\), so \(u_t=2u_{xx}\) holds. The boundary conditions are easily checked.
<hr>

<b>3</b> \(u_t = cf''(x)\) and \(u_{xx} = f''(x)\), since
the fourth derivative of \(f(x)\) is zero. Substituting \(t=0\) verifies the
initial condition.
<hr>

<b>5</b> Set \(x=\pi j/(m+1)\). For \(i=1,\ldots, m\), the
\(i\)th row of \(Tv_j\) is the left side of (8.11),
by the definitions of \(T\) and \(v_j\) in (8.10) and (8.12). (Notice that when
\(i=1\), \(\sin (i-1)x = 0\), and when \(i=m\), \(\sin (i+1)x = \sin (m+1)\pi j/(m+1)
 = \sin \pi j = 0\).) Thus (8.13) holds because its right-hand side matches the
right-hand side of (8.11).
