<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEMS 12.1</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle} \def\l{\lambda} \)
<b>1 (a)</b> For example, if initial vector \(x_0=[0,0,1]^T\) is used in
Matlab Program 12.1 <tt>powerit</tt>, some of the Rayleigh quotients are
\(
\l_{7}= 4.0911,
\l_{8}= 4.0680,
\l_{9}= 4.0507,
\l_{10}= 4.0380.
\)
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([1,1,-1]\) and
the Rayleigh quotients converge to \(4\), in agreement with Exercise 5(a).
The ratios of errors at successive steps are approximately \(3/4\),
in agreement with Theorem 12.2.<p>
<b>1 (b)</b> Similar to part (a).
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([1,1,-1]\) and
the Rayleigh quotients converge to \(-4\), in agreement with Exercise 5(b).<p>
<b>1 (c)</b>
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([1,1,-1]\) and
the Rayleigh quotients converge to \(4\), in agreement with Exercise 5(c).<p>
<b>1 (d)</b>
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([1,1,-1]\) and
the Rayleigh quotients converge to \(10\), in agreement with Exercise 5(d).

<b>3 (a)</b> For example, assume that initial vector \(x_0=[0,0,1]^T\) is used in
Matlab Program 12.2 <tt>invpowerit</tt>. After inverting and adding the
shift \(s=5\) to the Rayleigh quotients,  approximations are
\(
\l_5= 4.0166
\l_{6}=4.0080
\l_{7}=4.0040
\l_8= 4.0020
\)
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([1,1,-1]\) and
the eigenvalue approximations converge to \(4\) with convergence rate
constant \(S\approx 1/2\), in agreement with Exercise 8(a).<p>
<b>3 (b)</b> Similar to part (a).
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([0,1,-2]\) and
the eigenvalue approximations converge to \(3\).<p>
<b>3 (c)</b>
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([2,1,1]\) and
the eigenvalue approximations converge to \(2\).<p>
<b>3 (d)</b>
The eigenvector approximations converge to \([2,1,1]\) and
the eigenvalue approximations converge to \(9\).
