<h3>EXERCISES 8.2</h3>

<b>1 (a)</b> The partial derivatives are \(u_{tt}=-16\pi^2\sin
\pi x\cos 4\pi t\) and \(u_{xx}=-\pi^2\sin\pi x\cos 4\pi t\), so \(u\)
satisfies the wave equation. The initial and boundary conditions are
easily checked. <p>
<b>1 (b)</b> The partial derivatives are \(u_{tt}=4e^{-x-2t}\)
and \(u_{xx}=e^{-x-2t}\), so \(u\) satisfies the wave equation. The
initial and boundary conditions also check. <p>
<b>1 (c)</b> The partial derivatives are
\(u_{tt}=u_{xx}=-{(1+x+t)}^{-2}\). The initial and boundary conditions
also check.

<b>3</b> We check the equation by finding the partial derivatives of \(u_1(x,t)\),
which are
\((u_1)_{tt}=-c^2\alpha^2\sin\alpha x\cos c\alpha t\) and
\((u_1)_{xx}=-\alpha^2\sin\alpha x\cos c\alpha t\). Therefore \(u_1\) satisfies
the wave equation with wave velocity \(c\). The partial derivatives of
\(u_2(x,t)\) are \({(u_2)}_{tt}=c^2e^{x+ct}\) and
\({(u_2)}_{xx}=e^{x+ct}\), so \(u_2\) also satisfies the wave equation.

<b>5</b> Note that \(A=(2-\sigma^2)I-\sigma^2T\), where the matrix
\(T\) in (8.10) has eigenvalues between \(-1\) and \(3\). The eigenvectors
\(x\) of \(A\) are the same as those of \(T\), since
\(Ax=(2-\sigma^2)x-\sigma^2Tx=(2-\sigma^2-\sigma^2\lambda)x\), where
\(\lambda\) is the corresponding eigenvalue of \(T\). Therefore the
eigenvalues of \(A\) lie between \(2-\sigma^2-\sigma^2(-1)=2\) and
\((2-\sigma^2)-\sigma^2(3)=2-4\sigma^2\).
