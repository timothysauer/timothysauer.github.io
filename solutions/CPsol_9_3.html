<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEMS 9.3</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle} \)
<b>1 (a)</b> Each random walk starts at zero and increases or decreases
by one at each step. For example, one can
 generate a uniform random number \(x\) in \([0,1]\), increasing the
random walk if \(x<0.5\) and decreasing otherwise. After each step,
test to see if the random walk has reached either boundary of the
interval \([-b,a]\), in which case the walk is terminated.
Example results after repeating \(10^4\) times using
the minimal standard LCG with seed \(x_0=1\) are that the top \(5\) was
reached before the bottom \(-2\) a total of \(2907\) times. We calculate the
probability as \(0.2907\), which compares with the theoretical answer
of \(2/7\approx 0.2857\). The error is \(= 0.0050\).<p>
<b>1 (b)</b> Similar to (a), for interval \([-5,3]\). Monte-Carlo
approximation of probability of reaching the top is \(0.6323\)
with error \( 0.0073\).<p>
<b>1 (c)</b> Similar to (a), for interval \([-8,3]\). Monte-Carlo
approximation of probability of reaching the top is \(0.7322\) with
 error \( 0.0049\).

<b>3 (a)</b> The same program can be used as in Computer Problem 1, but
the random walk should increase if the uniform random number \(x\) in \([0,1]\)
satisfies \(x&lt p\), and decrease otherwise. Using the Minimal Standard
Generator, the probability of reaching \(5\) before \(-2\) using bias \(p=0.7\)
is estimated to be \(0.8199 \), with error \(=0.0014\) when compared with
the theoretical value \([((1-p)/p)^b-1]/[((1-p)/p)^{a+b}-1]\).<p>
<b>3 (b)</b> Similar to (a), on the interval \([-5,3]\). Monte-Carlo
estimate of probability of reaching \(3\) is  \(0.9871 \) with error \(=0.0004\).<p>
<b>3 (c)</b> Similar to (a), on the interval \([-8,3]\). Monte-Carlo
estimate of probability of reaching \(3\) is  \(0.9984 \) with error \(=0.0006 \).
<hr>

<b>5 (a)</b> The code in the text can be used to generate Brownian
motion. Starting at zero, using step size \(\Delta t=0.01\), the probability
of reaching \(5\) before \(-2\) is  \(0.297\), with error \(= 0.011\) when compared
with the theoretical value \(b/(a+b)=2/7\).  <p>
<b>5 (b)</b> Similar to (a). Estimated probability of reaching \(\pi\)
before \(-2\) is \(0.394\), with error \(= 0.005\) when compared with the
theoretical value \(2/(2+\pi)\).<p>
<b>5 (c)</b> Similar to (a). Estimated probability of reaching \(3\)
before \(-8/3\) is \(0.460\), with error \(= 0.011\) when compared with
the theoretical value \(8/17\).
<hr>

<b>7 (a)</b> Create Brownian motion simulations \(B_t\) with step size
\(\Delta t=0.01\). Beginning with time \(t_1\), after each time step,
calculate the product of
the two previous steps \(B_t\) and \(B_{t-1}\). If negative, the path has
crossed zero. Estimate the probability that at least one crossing
occurs between \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) as a Type 2 Monte Carlo simulation
with \(10^4\) realizations. For \(t_1=3, t_2=5\), an example simulation
yielded the estimated probability as
\(0.5848\), with error \(= 0.0207\) when compared with the theoretical
value \((2/\pi)\arcsin\sqrt{3/5}\).<p>
<b>7 (b)</b> Similar to (a). Estimated probability is \(0.3106\), error \(= 0.0154\).<p>
<b>7 (c)</b> Similar to (a). Estimated probability is \(0.7155\), error \(= 0.0107\).
