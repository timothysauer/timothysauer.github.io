<b>3 (b)</b> By Theorem 3.2, there is exactly one polynomial of degree
\(\leq 3\) that passes through all four points. This is the degree
\(2\) polynomial in (a). No degree \(3\) polynomial exists. <p>

The polynomial \(P(x)=8-2(x+2)\) passes through the four data
points. <p>
<b>5 (b)</b> According to Theorem 3.2, there are no other degree
\(\leq 3\) polynomials through the four data points, but
\(P_4(x)=8-2(x+2)+c(x+2)x(x-1)(x-3)\) interpolates for all \(c\).
<hr>

<b>7</b> By definition, \(P(x)\) passes through the points
\((1,0),...,(10,0),(12,44)\). In Lagrange form, the interpolating
polynomial can be written
\[
P(x) = 44\frac{(x-1)\cdots(x-10)}{(12-1)\cdots(12-10)}
\]
Substituting \(x=0\) gives
\({\ds
P(x) = 44\frac{(0-1)\cdots(0-10)}{(12-1)\cdots(12-10)} =
44\frac{1\times 2\times \cdots\times 10}{11\times 10 \times
\cdots\times 2} = 4.
}\)
<hr>

<b>9 (a)</b> For the data
points \((1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(7,10)\),
the Lagrange interpolating polynomial  is
\[
L(x) = 10\frac{(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-6)}{(7-1)(7-2)\cdots(7-6)}
\]
<b>9 (b)</b> The degree \(6\) polynomial asked for contains the seven
data points in (a). According to Theorem 3.2, there is only one
polynomial that does so, the one computed above. Therefore it
suffices to check whether the \(L(x)\) from part (a) passes through
\((8,70)\). Since
\[
L(8) = 10\frac{7\times 6\times \cdots\times 2}{6\times 5\times
\cdots\times 1} = 70
\]
the polynomial \(L(x)\) from part (a) also works for part (b).
<hr>

<b>11</b> Since the four points have distinct x-coordinates,
Theorem 3.2 implies that only one polynomial of degree \(\leq 3\)
passes through them. This polynomial is obviously the parabola
\(y=ax^2+bx+c\). Therefore no cubic polynomials pass through the
four points.
<hr>

<b>13</b> The polynomial \(Q(x)=P(x)-5\) passes through the points\nl
\((-5, 0), (-4, 0), (-3, 0), (-2, 0), (-1, 0), (0,0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 37)\). <p> The Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial is
\[Q(x) = 37\frac{(x+5)(x+4)(x+3)(x+2)(x+1)(x)(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)}{(5+5)(5+4)(5+3)(5+2)(5+1)(5)(5-1)(5-2)(5-3)(5-4)}.\]
Then
\[P(6) = Q(6)+5=37\frac{(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)}{(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}+5 = 412.\]
<hr>

<b>15</b> The constant term of a polynomial \(P(x)\) is \(P(0)\). Therefore we require the polynomial \(P(x)\) to pass through \((0, 25), (1, -1), (2, -2), \ldots, (25, -25)\).  Define \(Q(x) = P(x)+x\). The polynomial \(Q(x)\) passes through \((0, 25), (1, 0), (2, 0), \ldots, (25, 0)\). The Lagrange form is
\[Q(x) = 25\frac{(x-1)(x-2)\cdots (x-25)}{(0-1)(0-2)\cdots (0-25)}.\] Thus \({\ds P(x) = -x-\frac{25}{25!}(x-1)(x-2)\cdots (x-25) = -x-(x-1)(x-2)\cdots (x-25)/24!}\)
