<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEMS 1.2</h3>

<b>1 (a)</b> Define \(g(x)={(2x+2)}^{\frac{1}{3}}\), for example.
Using the <tt>fpi.py</tt> code, the commands
<pre>
def g(x): return  (2*x+2)**(1/3)
x=fpi(g,1/2,20)
</pre>
yields the solution \(1.76929235\) to 8 correct decimal places. <p>
<b>1 (b)</b> Define \(g(x)=\ln(7-x)\). Using <tt> fpi.py</tt> as in part (a)
returns the solution \(1.67282170\) to 8 correct decimal places. <p>
<b>1 (c)</b> Define \(g(x)=\ln(4-\sin x)\). Using <tt> fpi.py</tt> as in part
(a) returns the solution \(1.12998050\) to 8 correct decimal places.
<hr>

<b>3 (a)</b> Iterate \(g(x)=(x+3/x)/2\) with starting guess \(1\). After
4 steps of FPI, the results is \(1.73205081\) to 8 correct places. <p>
<b>3 (b)</b> Iterate \(g(x)=(x+5/x)/2\) with starting guess \(1\). After
5 steps of FPI, the results is \(2.23606798\) to 8 correct places.
<hr>

<b>5</b> Iterating \(g(x)=\cos^2x\) with initial guess \(x_0=1\)
results in \(0.641714\) to six correct places after \(350\) steps.
Checking \(|g'(0.641714)|\approx0.96\) verifies that FPI is locally
convergent by Theorem 1.6.
<hr>

<b>7 (a)</b> Almost all numbers between \(0\) and \(1\). <p>
<b>7 (b)</b> Almost all numbers between \(1\) and \(2\). <p>
<b>7 (c)</b> Any number greater than \(3\) or less than \(-1\) will
work.
