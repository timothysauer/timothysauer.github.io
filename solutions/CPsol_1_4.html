<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEMS 1.4</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle} \)
<b>1 (a)</b> Newton's Method is
\(x_{i+1}=x_i-(x_i^3-2x_i-2)/(3x_i^2-2)\). Setting \(x_0=1\) yields
\(x_7=1.76929235\) to eight decimal places. <p>
<b>1 (b)</b> Applying Newton's Method with \(x_0=1\) yields
\(x_5=1.67282170\) to eight places. <p>
<b>1 (c)</b> Applying Newton's Method with \(x_0=1\) yields
\(x_3=1.12998050\) to eight places.
<hr>

<b>3 (a)</b> Newton's Method converges linearly to
\(x_c=-0.6666648\). Subtracting \(x_c\) from \(x_i\) shows error ratios
\(|x_{i+1}-x_c|/|x_i-x_c|\approx\frac{2}{3}\), implying a
multiplicity \(3\) root. Applying Modified Newton's Method with
\(m=3\) and \(x_0=0.5\) converges to \(x_c=-\frac{2}{3}\). <p>
<b>3 (b)</b> Newton's Method converges linearly to
\(x_c=0.166666669\). The error ratios
\(|x_{i+1}-x_c|/|x_i-x_c|\approx\frac{1}{2}\), implying a
multiplicity \(2\) root. Applying Modified Newton's Method with
\(m=2\) and \(x_0=1\) converges quadratically to
\(0.166666667\approx\frac{1}{6}\). In fact, one checks by direct
substitution that the root is \(r=\frac{1}{6}\).
<hr>

<b>5</b> The volume of the silo is \(400=10\pi r^2+\frac{2}{3}\pi
r^3\). Solving for \(r\) by Newton's Method yields \(3.2362\) meters.
<hr>

<b>7</b> Newton's Method converges quadratically to \(-1.197624\) and
\(1.530134\), and converges linearly to the root \(0\). The error
ratio is \(|x_{i+1}-0|/|x_i-0|\approx\frac{3}{4}\), implying that
\(r=0\) is a multiplicity \(4\) root. This can be confirmed by
evaluating the first four derivatives.
<hr>

<b>9</b> Newton's Method converges quadratically to \(0.8571428571\)
with quadratic error ratio \(\ds M=\lim_{i\to\infty} e_{i+1}/e_i^2\approx 2.4\), and
converges linearly to the root \(2\) with error ratio \(
S=\lim_{i\to\infty}e_{i+1}/e_i\approx\frac{2}{3}\).
<hr>

<b>11</b> Solving the ideal gas law for an initial approximation
gives \(V_0=nRT/P=1.75\). Applying Newton's Method to the non-ideal gas Van der
Waal's equation with initial guess \(V_0=1.75\)
converges to \(V=1.701\).
<hr>

<b>13 (a)</b> The equation is equivalent to \(1-3/(4x)=0\), and has
the root \(r=\frac{3}{4}\). <p>
<b>13 (b)</b> Newton's Method applied to
\(f(x)={(1-3/(4x))}^{\frac{1}{3}}\) does not converge. <p>
<b>13 (c)</b> \(f(x)\) is not differentiable at \(0\).
<hr>

<b>15</b> We solve the equation \(f(H) = \pi H^2(1-H/3) - 1 = 0\) for \(H\). We use the derivative
\(f'(H) = \pi H (2-H)\). The Newton Method iteration converges in 5 steps to \(H = 0.635.5\) meters.

<hr>
<b>17(a)</b> We solve the equation \(f(r) = (P(0) + m/r)*e^{10r}-m/r - P(10) = 0\) for \(r\), where
\(m = 0.977, P(0) = 248.7, P(10) = 281.4\). We use the derivative
\(f'(r) = e^{10r}(10P(10)-m/r^2+10m/r)+m/r^2\). The Newton Method iteration converges in
a few steps to \(r = 0.0086589\).<p>
<b>17(b)</b> We solve the equation \(f(r) = (P(0) + m/r)*e^{10r}-m/r - P(10) = 0\) for \(r\), where
\(m = 1.030, P(0) = 281.4, P(10) = 308.7\). We use the derivative
\(f'(r) = e^{10r}(10P(10)-m/r^2+10m/r)+m/r^2\). The Newton Method iteration converges in
a few steps to \(r = 0.0057643\).
