<h3>EXERCISES 13.1</h3>
\(\def\ds{\displaystyle}  \def\l{\lambda}\)
<b>1 (a)</b> The derivative is \(f'(x)=e^x-e^{-x}\), which is zero
if and only if \(x=0\). Furthermore, \(f'(x)&lt 0\) for \(x&lt 0\) and \(f'(x)&gt 0\)
for \(x&gt 0\). Therefore \(f\) is unimodal on \((-\infty, \infty)\)
and has an absolute minimum at \((x,y)=(0,2)\). <p>
<b>1 (b)</b> The expression \(x^6\) is positive if and only if \(x\neq 0\),
and equals zero at \(x=0\). Therefore \((0,0)\) is the absolute minimum.
The derivative is \(f'(x)=6x^5\), which is negative for \(x&lt 0\) and positive for
\(x&gt 0\), so \(f\) is unimodal on \((-\infty, \infty)\). <p>
<b>1 (c)</b> The derivative \(f'(x)=8x^3+1\) is equal to zero if and only if
\(x=-1/2\), is negative for \(x&lt -1/2\), and is positive for \(x&gt -1/2\). Therefore
\((-1/2,-3/8)\) is the absolute minimum of the unimodal function.<p>
<b>1 (d)</b> The derivative is \(f'(x)=1-1/x\), which equals zero if and
only if \(x=1\), is negative for \(0&lt x&lt 1\), and positive for \(x&gt 1\).
Thus \(f\) is unimodal on \((0,\infty)\) and the absolute minimum occurs
at \((1,1)\).
