<h2>Additional Examples 0.1 </h1>

<b>1</b> 
Use nested multiplication to evaluate the polynomial \(P(x) = x^6-2x^5+3x^4-4x^3+5x^2-6x+7\) at \(x=2\).
<p>
<hr>
\(P(x) =7+x(-6 + x ( 5+x(-4+x(3+x(-2 + x))))) \). Evaluating from the inside out, the expression yields \(P(2) = 31\).

<hr><hr>

<b>2</b> 
Rewrite the polynomial \( P(x) = 3x^{18}-5x^{15}+4x^{12}+2x^6-x^3+4 \) in nested form. How many additions and how many multiplications are required for each input \(x\)?
.<p>
<hr>
In nested form,  \( P(x) = 4+x^3(-1+x^3(2+x^3(0+x^3(4+x^3(-5+x^3(3)))))) \). Given an input \( x \), two multiplications are needed to obtain \(x^3\). The nested polynomial needs 6 multiplications and 5 additions (adding zero is not counted) for a total of 8 multiplications and 5 additions.
